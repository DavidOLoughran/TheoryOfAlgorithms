This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks discussing Post Correspondence Problem and The Countdown Game.

## Post Correspondence Problem
- Explanation of Post Correspondence Problem
- Explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
- Solving Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
- Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory


## The Countdown Game
- explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game
- complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game
- Solving the Countdown Numbers Game

## Getting started

* [Install](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) Anaconda 
* [Install](https://jupyter.org/install) Jupyter Notebook 


## Run locally on your machine
1. Download / Clone this repository into a folder through the command line.<br/>
```sh

   ```
2. Navigate the command line until you are inside the projects folder.<br/>
- Once in the correct folder enter the following command to run Jupyter Notebook
```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. If everything is set up correctly a tab in your broswer should be opened or follow the link displayed in the console as follows
